## How it works

If you input wrong inputs, the period will light up. if the three numbers you need to guess are on without the period being enabled, you win when the S lights up without a decimal.

## How to test

Toggle 2, 5, and 6 without toggling any others and the S will light up without the decimal.

## External hardware

LED display
